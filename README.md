# type-project
In this project i built a typer.
You can use this code for your own projects.

You use this script by adding to following to your HTML:
<div><div id="text"></div><div id="blinker">&nbsp;</div></div>

After you did that you need to create a on load witch is: typeHandler(); blinkerHandler();

To use your own text you need to call the function: setTextArray(array).
This function expects a array to be send as a paramter
